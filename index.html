        <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p>
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
          learning, then try to create simple projects using what i learned or
          work new techniques into existing projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what i
          was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
        </p>
        <h2>Hoow I got started</h2>
        <p>
          I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
          take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
          use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
          short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
        </p>
        <p>
          That helped me grok what I was learning, and i realized that posting
          my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
          motivated.
